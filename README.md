Ultracold UB is an open science project started in 2017.  
The main goal was to build interactive code to play with quasionedimensional Bose-Einstein condensates by pinning dark and bright solitons. 

This package has been used extensively as the main tool to do science popularisation in the [ultracold UB project](https://serviparticules.ub.edu/lab-fisica-computacional).
